# Interactive-Data-Exploration-Tool

This project provides an interactive data exploration tool using Jupyter Notebook widgets. It allows users to upload a CSV file, select columns for analysis, and generate various plots to explore the data visually.

---

## Features

1. **CSV File Upload**: Easily upload a CSV file for analysis.
2. **Dynamic Column Selection**: Select specific columns from the dataset for exploration.
3. **Plot Types**: Generate the following types of visualizations:
   - Histogram
   - Bar Plot
   - Box Plot
   - Scatter Plot
4. **Interactive Widgets**: Use intuitive widgets to select columns, configure plot types, and visualize data directly in Jupyter Notebook.

2. **Run the Script**: Copy and paste the script into a Jupyter Notebook cell and run it.
3. **Step 1: Upload a CSV File**:
   - Use the file upload widget to upload a CSV file.
   - The script will display the first few rows and basic information about the dataset.
4. **Step 2: Select Columns for Analysis**:
   - Use the dropdown to select columns of interest.
   - Click the "Confirm Selection" button.
5. **Step 3: Generate Plot**:
   - Choose a plot type (Histogram, Bar, Box, or Scatter).
   - Click the "Generate Plot" button to visualize the data.
6. **Iterate**: You can change the column selection or plot type and regenerate plots as needed.
